    "abstract": "In the healthcare industry, the ever-increasing volume of clinical trial data presents challenges for ensuring drug safety and detecting adverse drug reactions (ADRs). This study aims to address the challenge of accurately detecting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in pharmacovigilance, a critical component in ensuring drug safety during and after clinical trials. The key problem lies in the underreporting and delayed detection of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) due to the heterogeneous nature of medical data, class imbalance, and the limited scope of traditional monitoring techniques. This study proposes a hybrid AI-driven framework that integrates structured (e.g., patient demographics, lab results) and unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes) to detect ADRs using advanced deep learning and NLP methods. The objective is to outperform traditional signal detection methods and provide interpretable predictions to aid clinicians in real-time. By leveraging advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, including Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), our model aims to identify potential ADRs across different patient subgroups. Through meticulous feature engineering and the application of techniques to address data imbalance, our model demonstrates improved accuracy and interpretability in predicting ADRs. The CNN model achieved an accuracy of 85 %, outperforming traditional models, such as Logistic Regression (78 %) and Support Vector Machines (80 %). These findings suggest that specific demographic and clinical factors significantly influence the likelihood of adverse reactions, offering valuable insights for targeted monitoring and risk mitigation strategies[11]. This research underscores the potential of predictive modeling to enhance pharmacovigilance efforts and ensure safer clinical trial outcomes.&#x2022;The research methodology includes a comparison of supervised learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, CNN, and genetic algorithms, to identify patterns and anomalies in clinical trial data. BERT and GPT, were also employed to provide the functionality of textual interactions over medical data.&#x2022;Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were systematically applied to evaluate each model's performance. Among the models tested, the CNN model with BERT achieved the highest accuracy, providing valuable insights into the potential of deep learning for enhancing pharmacovigilance practices.&#x2022;These findings suggest that an inclusion of diverse clinical data when supplied to advanced ML and NLP techniques can significantly improve the detection of ADRs, leading to better alignment with the fundamental principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP).",

The study followed the recommendations of the Joanna Briggs Institute and PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. The searches were conducted in the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Studies evaluating efficacy, physical and chemical properties, cytotoxicity, and preventive effect against recurrent caries lesions provided by antibacterial resin-based composites published in the last 5 years and without language restriction were included. Fifty-three papers were analyzed. Only <i>in vitro, in situ</i>, and animal studies were published. The DMAHDM (dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate) was the most prevalent antibacterial agent in the resin composites and showed efficacy, did not increase cytotoxicity, nor jeopardize chemical and physical properties. The most used biofilm model and the test to evaluate the antibacterial effect was Streptococcus Mutans and the Colony Forming Unit Count. Antibacterial resin-based composites have performed exceedingly well in the large number of <i>in vitro</i> studies evaluated. However, clinical trials assessing the prevention of recurrent caries are absent and need to be further conducted to assure that using an antibacterial resin composite is a valid way to avoid restoration replacement due to recurrent caries.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous data availability.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer perception (CP) technologies use mobile sensors to collect behavioral and physiological data for clinical decision-making. These tools can reshape how clinical knowledge is generated and interpreted. However, effective integration of these tools into clinical workflows depends on how developers balance clinical utility with user acceptability and trustworthiness. Our study presents findings from 20 in-depth interviews with developers of AI-based CP tools. Interviews were transcribed and inductive, thematic analysis was performed to identify 4 key design priorities: 1) to account for context and ensure explainability for both patients and clinicians; 2) align tools with existing clinical workflows; 3) appropriately customize to relevant stakeholders for usability and acceptability; and 4) push the boundaries of innovation while aligning with established paradigms. Our findings highlight that developers view themselves as not merely technical architects but also ethical stewards, designing tools that are both acceptable by users and epistemically responsible (prioritizing objectivity and pushing clinical knowledge forward). We offer the following suggestions to help achieve this balance: documenting how design choices around customization are made, defining limits for customization choices, transparently conveying information about outputs, and investing in user training. Achieving these goals will require interdisciplinary collaboration between developers, clinicians, and ethicists.",

    "abstract": "As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.",

We investigate advanced methodologies incorporating formal privacy models and risk-aware frameworks, and address the specialized subfield of authorship anonymization. Additionally, we review evaluation frameworks, comprehensive metrics, benchmarks, and practical toolkits for real-world deployment of anonymization solutions. This review consolidates current knowledge, identifies emerging trends and persistent challenges, including the evolving privacy-utility trade-off, the need to address quasi-identifiers, and the implications of LLM capabilities, and aims to guide future research directions for both academics and practitioners in this field.",

    "abstract": "Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities. Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision (achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1). For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom, heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective, achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523 for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized, high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).",

    "abstract": "The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines the process of converting Python-based neural network models into SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.",

    "abstract": "Technological innovations in medicine are increasingly expected to replicate the diagnostic, decision-making, and procedural skills of experienced physicians. This review explores the evolution, current status, and limitations of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic surgery in clinical practice. Radiology and pathology have led the way in digital transformation, enabling AI applications through standardized datasets and electronic health records. However, limitations such as algorithmic opacity, legal-ethical uncertainties, and fragmented digital infrastructures continue to hinder broader implementation. In robotic surgery, soft tissue procedures have not yet demonstrated significant advantages over conventional laparoscopy in terms of cost or operative efficiency. Orthopedic applications, particularly in arthroplasty, are promising but still lack long-term validation. Importantly, for any technology to create true value in healthcare, its benefits must clearly outweigh its costs. As healthcare systems face mounting pressure from aging populations and rising procedural demand, particularly for cholecystectomy, prostatectomy, and arthroplasty, the development of efficient and scalable technologies becomes inevitable. While neither AI nor robotic surgery has yet fulfilled its transformative promise, historical trends suggest that innovation will persist toward overcoming these barriers.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities across medical disciplines, yet their performance in basic medical sciences remains incompletely characterized. Medical histology, requiring factual knowledge and interpretative skills, provides a unique domain for evaluating AI capabilities in medical education. To evaluate and compare the performance of five current LLMs: GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek R1 on correctly answering medical histology multiple choice questions (MCQs). This cross-sectional comparative study used 200 USMLE-style histology MCQs across 20 topics. Each LLM completed all the questions in three separate attempts. Performance metrics included accuracy rates, test-retest reliability (ICC), and topic-specific analysis. Statistical analysis employed ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's tests and two-way mixed ANOVA for system-topic interactions. All LLMs achieved exceptionally high accuracy (Mean 91.1%, SD 7.2). Gemini performed best (92.0%), followed by Claude (91.5%), Copilot (91.0%), GPT-4 (90.8%), and DeepSeek (90.3%), with no significant differences between systems (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Claude showed the highest reliability (ICC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.931), followed by GPT-4 (ICC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.882). Complete accuracy and reproducibility (100%) were detected in Histological Methods, Blood and Hemopoiesis, and Circulatory System, while Muscle tissue (76.0%) and Lymphoid System (84.7%) presented the greatest challenges. LLMs demonstrate exceptional accuracy and reliability in answering histological MCQs, significantly outperforming other medical disciplines. Minimal inter-system variability suggests technological maturity, though topic-specific challenges and reliability concerns indicate the continued need for human expertise. These findings reflect rapid AI advancement and identify histology as particularly suitable for AI-assisted medical education.<b>Clinical trial number</b>: The clinical trial number is not pertinent to this study as it does not involve medicinal products or therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights for healthcare applications.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable domain-specific question answering using external knowledge. However, addressing information that is not included in training data remains a challenge, particularly in nuclear medicine, where examination protocols are frequently updated and vary across institutions. In this study, we developed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system using 40 internal manuals from a single Japanese hospital, each corresponding to a different examination in nuclear medicine. These institution-specific documents were segmented and indexed using a hybrid retrieval strategy combining dense vector search (text-embedding-3-small) and sparse keyword search (BM25). GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o were used with the OpenAI application programming interface (API) for response generation. The quality of the generated answers was assessed using a four-point Likert scale by three certified radiological technologists, of which one held an additional certification in nuclear medicine and another held an additional certification in medical physics. Automated evaluation was conducted using RAGAS metrics, including factual correctness and context recall. The GPT-4o model combined with hybrid retrieval achieved the highest performance, as per expert evaluations. Although traditional string-based metrics such as ROUGE and the Levenshtein distance poorly align with human ratings, RAGAS provided consistent rankings across system configurations, despite showing only a modest correlation with manual scores. These findings demonstrate that integrating examination-specific institutional manuals into RAG frameworks can effectively support domain-specific question answering in nuclear medicine. Moreover, LLM-based evaluation methods such as RAGAS may serve as practical tools to complement expert reviews in developing healthcare-oriented artificial intelligence systems.",

    "abstract": "Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care, but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes, simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available. Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third, we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.",

We conducted a cross-sectional, mixed-methods study involving Year 2-4 medical students at Qatar University, where participants completed and evaluated three anonymized MCQ sets-authored by ChatGPT, Google-Gemini, and a clinical anatomist-across 17 quality criteria. Descriptive and chi-square analyses were performed, and optional feedback was reviewed thematically. Among 48 participants, most rated the three MCQ sources as equally effective, although ChatGPT was more often preferred for helping students identify and confront their knowledge gaps through challenging distractors and diagnostic insight, while expert-written questions were rated highest for deeper analytical thinking. A significant variation in preferences was observed across sources (&#x3c7;&#xb2; (64) = 688.79, <i>p</i> &lt; .001). Qualitative feedback emphasized the need for better difficulty calibration and clearer distractors in some AI-generated items. Overall, LLM-generated anatomy MCQs can closely match expert-authored ones in learner-perceived value and may support deeper engagement, but expert review remains critical to ensure clarity and alignment with curricular goals. A hybrid AI-human workflow may provide a promising path for scalable, high-quality assessment design in medical education.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, the field of signal processing has rapidly evolved due to diverse application demands, leading to a rich array of scientific questions and research areas. The forms of signals, their formation mechanisms, and the information extraction methods vary by application, resulting in diverse signal processing techniques. Common techniques can be categorized into three types: transformation, detection, and filtering. Signal transformation converts signals from their original domain to a more suitable target domain for analysis; signal detection aims to identify the existence of relevant information within a signal and its specific time and location; and signal filtering focuses on extracting or separating source signals of interest from observed signals. In acoustic signal processing, techniques include sound source localization, sound event detection, voiceprint extraction and recognition, noise reduction, and source separation, with applications in speech communication, voice interaction, smart healthcare, and industrial diagnostics. Recently, the advancement of deep learning technologies has shifted methodologies in acoustic signal processing from knowledge-driven to data-driven approaches, leading to significant research outcomes. This paper aims to systematically summarize the principles and methods of data-driven acoustic signal processing, providing a comprehensive understanding framework for academic exploration and practical applications.",

For the Thanzi La Onse model in Malawi we have incorporated an approach to production that is based on a form of Leontief technology -- fixed input proportions. At first sight, this form of technology appears restrictive relative to the general conception of a production function employed in economics. In particular, the Leontief technology is associated with constant returns to scale, and level sets that are piecewise linear, both of which are highly restrictive properties. In this article we demonstrate that once incorporated into an all disease, agent-based model these properties are no longer present and the Leontief framework becomes a rich structure for describing healthcare production, and hence for examining the returns to health systems investments.",
